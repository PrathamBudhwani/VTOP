## General Queries

### üîíIs it safe?

It is just as secure as the official VTOP of VIT Bhopal. This app is internally making requests to VTOP on the user's behalf and then displays the response it receives. Additionally, it is open source, meaning the full source code is accessible online to anyone (see about section in the app).

To do that it uses WebView which allows apps to display content from the web directly inside an application just like a browser.

### ü•±How is this app any better than the Official VTOP Website / Client?

With the help of this app, users will be able to complete particular activities quickly and easily. This is what the app aims to achieve because in today's society we expect everything we use on a regular basis to be mobile-friendly and user-friendly. Behind the UI wall, this app hides a variety of issues and errors that are encountered in the VTOP.

Note: It only ports a few¬†elements of Official VTOP, hence the moniker "mini VTOP," and it was not designed to, and will never be able to, replace Official VTOP.

### üéØWhat it can do?

- User can login with one tap after the initial login.
- Shows the schedule in an intuitive way, for instance, it displays the current class as well as the classes that will be held on a particular day.
- Quickly displays attendance and CGPA.
- Offline mode for records that have previously been viewed. Useful if VTOP or the internet is down.
- Several additional features, such as the VIT calendar, full academic records, test schedule viewers, etc., will soon be introduced.
